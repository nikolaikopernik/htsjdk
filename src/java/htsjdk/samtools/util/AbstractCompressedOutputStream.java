/**
 * Writer for a file that is a series of gzip blocks (BGZF format).  The caller just treats it as an
 * OutputStream, and under the covers a gzip block is written when the amount of uncompressed as-yet-unwritten
 * bytes reaches a threshold.
 *
 * The advantage of BGZF over conventional gzip is that BGZF allows for seeking without having to scan through
 * the entire file up to the position being sought.
 *
 * Note that the flush() method should not be called by client
 * unless you know what you're doing, because it forces a gzip block to be written even if the
 * number of buffered bytes has not reached threshold.  close(), on the other hand, must be called
 * when done writing in order to force the last gzip block to be written.
 *
 * c.f. http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf for details of BGZF file format.
